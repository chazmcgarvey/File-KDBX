=head1 NAME

File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse - A challenge-response key

=head1 VERSION

version 0.900

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse;

    my $responder = sub {
        my $challenge = shift;
        ...;    # generate a response based on a secret of some sort
        return $response;
    };
    my $key = File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse->new($responder);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A challenge-response key is kind of like multifactor authentication, except you don't really I<authenticate>
to a KDBX database because it's not a service. Specifically it would be the "what you have" component. It
assumes there is some device that can store a key that is only known to the owner of a database. A challenge
is made to the device and the response generated based on the key is used as the raw key.

Inherets methods and attributes from L<File::KDBX::Key>.

This is a generic implementation where a responder subroutine is provided to provide the response. There is
also L<File::KDBX::Key::YubiKey> which is a subclass that allows YubiKeys to be responder devices.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 raw_key

    $raw_key = $key->raw_key;
    $raw_key = $key->raw_key($challenge);

Get the raw key which is the response to a challenge. The response will be saved so that subsequent calls
(with or without the challenge) can provide the response without challenging the responder again. Only one
response is saved at a time; if you call this with a different challenge, the new response is saved over any
previous response.

=head2 challenge

    $response = $key->challenge($challenge, @options);

Issue a challenge and get a response, or throw if the responder failed to provide one.
